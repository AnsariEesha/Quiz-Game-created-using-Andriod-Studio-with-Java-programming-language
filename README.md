Built the “QUIZ GAME” application that incorporates the basic concepts of Mobile Development using Android OS. Solely using Java programming language.
The run the project load the whole project in the Andriod Studio and then build and run it.
# Application Description:
We have built a multiple-choice quiz application which stores its questions in an SQLite
database. In the start of application, it will ask the player to enter its name and start the quiz.
After starting the quiz, it will display the questions one at a time and will counts the points for
each correct answer and add it to the score board and if the answer is wrong it does nothing,
it also tells that how many questions will be given and increase the question counter after
every question, so it gives the player an idea that how many questions are left to attempt. In
the end of quiz, it will tell the player that how many of its answers were right and how many
were wrong, it will also give you the final score of your quiz and will ask you if you want to
restart the game.
